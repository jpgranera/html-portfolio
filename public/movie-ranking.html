<h1>The Best Movies According to JP üé•</h1>

<h2>üçø My top 3 movies of all-time üçø</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. The Godfather (1972)</h3>
<h4>üì¢ Oh my Godfather!</h4>
<p>I don't know how I had not watched this film until just a week ago, but I'm glad because this is not a movie to watch with distractions or when you are too young because you will not enjoy it as much as an adult does. I saw this movie and immediately become an addict, watched it at least 3 more times the same week. There is so much to talk about it! I found it hard to think someone doesn't enjoying this one. The cast, the great dialogue, big plot twists, all the emotions, everything makes it just great. This is no a film as many of these times that need a 4K quality to be appealing, you will not waste your time, every minute of the almost 3 hours is worth. You will want even more. If you haven't watch it, what are you waiting for? ("This is an offer you can't refuse")

<h3>2. The Shawshank Redemption (1994)</h3>
<h4>üì¢ Best prison movie of all time!</h4>
<p>It is a movie that catches your attention from start to end. Besides the great storytelling, what I most love about this one is the great cast with strong performances and the fact that the main character is indeed intelligent. He is very smart along the movie, so clever most of us didn't see his plan coming. Every character in the film has a very defined personality and adds to the plot. The ending is great.</p>

<h3>3. Toy Story (1995)</h3>
<h4>üì¢ Old but gold</h4>
<p>Simply a masterpiece. When the Pixar Studio and John Lasseter decided to do the first animated film, they would never do a film just as an "experiment", nor make it fast and neglect the story and the technical things. They worked for years to deliver to the world a new way to make films and a wonderful story that is appealing for people all ages. The dialogues are great and funny, every single character has a defined personality, it's perfect technically speaking and lives to date, helping as a standard for new animated movies.</p>
